# VS Code Extension for 65816 SNES Assembly

This extension provides the following features for 65816 Assembly targeting the SNES:
- Syntax Hilighting
- Opcode Autocompletion with Descriptions
- Opcode Documentation via Hover
- ASAR Syntax Autocompletion

Additionally, documentation when hovering over addresses (`$09A6`, `$8098B4`, etc.) can be enabled for the following games:
- Super Metroid
- Super Mario World (TBD)

This project started as an attempt to build a Super Metroid version of [65816-SNES-Assembly](https://github.com/vicerust/65816-SNES-Assembly) by [Vice](https://github.com/vicerust) and much of the data/documentation originated from their work. 65816 language syntax orginated from [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshneta.65816-assembly&ssr=false). Opcode documentation originated from randomdude999 and [this site](https://media.smwcentral.net/randomdude999/snes_references/65C816_opcodes.html).
